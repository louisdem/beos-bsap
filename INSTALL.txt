BUILD
Just open bsap.proj in BeIDE and build.
After that you can reduce its size by using Terminal, and from command line doing:
	strip -R .comment -R .note BSAP

Dictionary data files are in lib/, you should copy them to another location (e.g.
/boot/home/config/share/sap or something similar).
Contents of locale/ should be copied to /boot/home/config/locale/

NOTES
Bug list (empty! :), things to fix and do (in the future) is at the top of bydpmainwindow.cpp
Source files and classes have 'ydp' in their names because when I started this was
supposed to be interface for Collins dictionaries, released by YDP Poland. Finally, something
more general has been written.

LEGAL
Although files don't have that note at their top (I was too lazy to add it) - everything that is
packaged in this archive is under terms of GNU/GPL (included). It means that you are free to
use this code in your programs as long as they are under GNU/GPL too. I don't have to mention
that you should mention the origin of the code then.

FUTURE
After finishing TODO list it would be nice to write more dictionary engines - all you have to do
is to write inherited Engine and Convert classes. One idea might be to use SQLite database
to store data and edit it with a separate application (BeAccessible or QueryLite).

READY-FOR-USE CODE
Take a look at bydpListView. It allows to comfortably handle element list with a slider.
It differs from BListView inside BScrollView because my class doesn't have problems with
handling thousands of elements on the list. (BScrollView is terrible with even just few hundred).

You might find bydpConfig class useful for managing text configuration files.

The code is under GNU/GPL terms. I encourage to use, correct and extend it in your own
projects. And if you do, I would be very happy to receive patches so they could be integrated
into future BSAP releases.
